## AI Usage Notes (ChatGPT 4.1)

### What AI helped with
- Designing the structure of Django models and their relationships
- Styling profile cards responsibly using Bootstrap
- Integrating and configuring Select2 for tag selection
- Writing and debugging template logic for profile card display
- Building pagination and customizing its appearance

### What AI didn't help with
- Handling edge cases in form validation
- Select2 behavior quirks (required additional manual tweaking)
- Fine-tuning responsiveness for long bios and field overflows

### Example prompts that I used
- ‚ÄúHow do I make a ManyToMany field in Django show as multi-select checkboxes with tags?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow can I make Bootstrap cards clickable links without wrapping the entire card in an <a> tag?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWrite a custom Django form that saves user info and a related profile model with image upload.‚Äù
